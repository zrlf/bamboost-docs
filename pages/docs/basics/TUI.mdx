# Terminal user interface

## Introduction

You can use the terminal user interface(TUI) to explore all your databases and
its simulations.

    <source src="/tui-showcase.webm" type="video/webm" />

## Configuration

The TUI can be configured using the configuration file at
`~/.config/bamboost/tui.toml`.This is mainly to customize the keybindings.

The TUI has different _views_(pages).Currently, only the keybindings in the
database view are customizable.You can view the keymaps in the TUI by pressing
`?`.
Edit the `[keybinds.database]` table in the config file to your liking.The
functions are named(also seeable in the TUI).You can simply assign a new key
to a function.

```toml filename='Example configuration file'
theme = "default" # or "highlight"

# Maximum column widths (default: 30)
[table]
no-cutoff-columns = [
"some column name",
...
]

# Keybindings
[keybinds]
custom_files = [
"/home/florez/.config/bamboost/functions.py",
]

[keybinds.database]
command = ":"
search = ","
jump = "/"
help = "?"
copy = "y"
open-paraview = "ctrl o"
open-xdmf-file = ["o", "x"]
open-output-file = ["o", "o"]
open-submission-file = ["o", "e"]
open-dir = ["o", "d"]
submit = [" ", "s"]
delete = "d"
note = ["o", "n"]
links = "L"
stdout = "ctrl t"
reload = "R"
page-down = "ctrl d"
page-up = "ctrl u"
next-search = "n"

# custom functions: table with key and function name
# the functions must take 2 arguments: size, key
plot = { key = "ctrl k", func = "show_plot" }
myjobs = { key = ["o", "m"], func = "show_job" }
cancel-job = { key = "C", func = "cancel_slurm_job" }
dummy = { key = ["m", "m"], func = "dummy_function" }
```

### Custom functions

You can extend the application with your own custom functions.

1. Include the file in which you define your function(s) in the`custom_files`
list of the `[keybinds]` table.
2. Add a keymap in the table `[keybinds.database]` by giving your functionality
a name and assigning to it a dictionary with an entry _key_ and _func_, which
needs to be the exact function name of a function defined in one of the
custom files.
3. The custom function must take two arguments: `size` & `key`.You can ignore
these if you don't need them. `size` is the size of the widget on which the
keypress is recorded. `key` is the key that was pressed.

<Callout type='info'>
To interact with the table itself, e.g.to get the simulation in focus, there is
a minimal API available.

```python filename='bamboostcli API'
from bamboostcli import api
sim = api.get_entry_in_focus()
database_widget = api.Database()
database_widget.container.footer.set_text("new footer text")
```
</Callout>
