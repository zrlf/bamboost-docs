Mainly the changes from merge request [!44](https://gitlab.com/cmbm-ethz/bamboost/-/merge_requests/44)

## Changes in 0.11

- Collection got a `sort` method similar to the `filter` method.
- Added **metadata** to collections using the existing collection identifier file and a yaml format.
- Added **aliases** to collections to allow easier referencing of collections.
- Updated the command line interface (CLI)


<Callout type="warning">
The sqlite database schema has changed. The file will be rebuilt and is now
named `bamboost.0.11.sqlite` to avoid conflicts with previous versions.

To migrate the existing database (will copy all knowledge to the new file), you
can use the CLI command:

```bash
bamboost-cli migrate
```
</Callout>

## Collection *sorting* and *iteration*

The following will filter the collection, then sort by one of the parameters,
and iterating over a collection will yield the simulations in the sorted order.

```python
from bamboost import Collection

coll = Collection(uid="<collection-uid>")

for sim in coll.filter(coll.k["temperature"] > 300).sort("pressure"):
    # then do something with each sim
    print(sim.uid)

# remember that you can also chain filter and sort
for sim in coll.filter(
    coll.k["temperature"] > 300, (coll.k["t"] < 3) | (coll.k["t"] > 7)
).sort("pressure"):
    pass

```


## Metadata for collections

Collections can now have metadata associated with them. The following metadata
fields are also stored in the sqlite database:
- `uid`
- `created_at`
- `tags`: a list of tags for this
- `aliases`: a list of alternative names for this collection
- `description`: a short description of the collection
- `author`: the author (either string or a dict with name, email)

Any number of additional metadata fields can be used.

### Using metadata

```python
from bamboost import Collection

coll = Collection(uid="<collection-uid>")

coll.metadata  # returns a CollectionMetadataStore object (a mapping)
coll.metadata["tags"]  # access individual metadata fields

coll.metadata.to_dict()  # returns all metadata as a dictionary
coll.metadata.update({"new_field": "value"})  # update metadata

coll.save()  # save changes to disk
```

<Callout type="info">
The changes are not automatically saved. You need to call `save()` on the collection to persist the changes.
</Callout>
