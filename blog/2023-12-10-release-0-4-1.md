Added functionality for `userdata`. To show the content of it, display the object `sim.userdata`.

### Simple way to store non field data
- Scalar, string, etc will are stored as attributes: `sim.userdata['some_name'] = value`
- Arrays are stored as datasets: `sim.userdata['array_name'] = arr`

Access is natural: `sim.userdata['some_name']` -> returns the stored value
