## Basic installation


To use the latest release of `bamboost`, install it using the python package
registry.

```bash
pip install bamboost
```

The package requires the following packages, which `pip` tries to install
automatically:

- [h5py](https://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/quick.html)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html)
- [mpi4py](https://mpi4py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html)

:::info[Issues with `mpi4py`]

If you run into issues installing `mpi4py`, make sure that a python distribution
containing the header files is installed on your system. Google this for your
distribution. On Linux, a suitable package will be named `python3-dev` or
`libpython3.8-dev` (insert the python version accordingly).

### Parallel support for writing HDF5 files

For MPI support, `h5py` needs to be compiled with MPI support. To do so, you
will need a local installation of the HDF5 library.
If you have this, you can build `h5py` with MPI support by running

```bash title="Install h5py with MPI support"
export CC=mpicc
export HDF5_MPI="ON"
pip install --force-reinstall --no-binary=h5py h5py
```

## Installation in editable mode
If you plan to modify the source code, you can install `bamboost` in editable
mode. This will allow you to modify the source code and use the modified
version without having to reinstall the package.

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.com:cmbm-ethz/bamboost.git
cd bamboost
pip install -e .
```
