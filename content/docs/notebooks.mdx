- improved **reprs** for various objects, e.g. groups inside the simulations `data.h5` file.
- completion of collections using `Collection.fromUID[...]`
- completion of simulations using `sim = coll[...]`
- completion of files inside a simulation using `file_path = sim.files[...]`
- completion of simulation data:
  - fields as part of series, e.g. `sim.data[...]`
  - subgroups/datasets in any hdf5 group, e.g. `sim.root[...]` (`sim.root` is the root group inside `data.h5`)
