title: Field data
---

Series contain two different type of data -- **Field** and **Global** data.

- **Field data**: Large dataset usually tied to a mesh, or a structure of some kind.
  For these, each step will create a new dataset named after the step number, $e.g$ "0",
  "1", "2", ...
- **Global data**: Smaller, usually global data. This could be a scalar (total energy,
  ...), a small vector or tensor, ...
  Other than field data, steps of global data share the dataset. I.e. only a single
  dataset exists for each _global_.
