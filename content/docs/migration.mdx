This highlights the differences if you have used the alpha versions of
`bamboost` and are now migrating to the new versions.

<Callout type="warn">

The new version of bamboost is incompatible with the alpha versions, and
therefore decoupled. Data collected using the alpha versions will not be
picked up and <span className="underline">you will have to use the old versions to manage your old data </span>

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  The new and old versions do not interfere and can be used side by side.
</Callout>
