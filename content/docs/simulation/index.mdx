Every [collection](/docs/collection) is made off many simulations.
On the individual simulation level, `bamboost` offers an extensive API to make writing and
reading of numeric data as easy as possible.


A big part of `bamboost` is its data model for simulation data.
Every simulation has:

- A [**primary hdf5 file**](#primary-hdf-file) named `data.h5`
  This is the core of each simulation.
  It holds it's **metadata**, **parameters**, and **data**.
- (optional, but likely) An executable that computes the result
- (optional, but likely) A bash script that usable to start the executable (or to submit
  it to a HPC task scheduler)
- (optional) Any other files relevant to the user


## Primary hdf file

The bamboost interface for simulations is built around `h5py`.

The file data structure is illustrated below.

<div className='w-full h-60 bg-fd-secondary rounded-xl flex flex-col justify-center text-center'>
Placeholder...
</div>

## Mutability

By default, the hdf file is **immutable**. This means that no `bamboost` code will edit the file. However, the file itself is still mutable, so be careful when using pure `h5py`.

To allow editing with `bamboost`, you must obtain a [SimulationWriter](/apidocs/simulation/base#SimulationWriter):
```python
sim_editable = sim.edit()
```
