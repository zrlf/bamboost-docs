# Configuration

A few global options are available. Bamboost can be configured using the
configuration file at `~/.config/bamboost/config.toml`.

```yaml title="Example configuration file"
[options]
# uncomment to disable mpi support
mpi = true

# default column to sort dataframes by
sort_table_key = 'time_stamp'
sort_table_order = 'desc'  # or 'asc'

# sync database tables with sqlite database on the fly
sync_tables = true

[index]
# the list of paths to search for databases
paths = [
    '/home/florez/work/',
    '/home/florez/journal/',
]
```

## Options

- **mpi**: this switch disables the import of *mpi4py* and thus disables all mpi
  functionality. This is useful if you never use mpi anyway as most of the
  import time of `bamboost` is due to the import of MPI.

<Callout type="info">
You can disable MPI for the current shell by setting the environment variable
`BAMBOOST_MPI = "0"`.
</Callout>

- **sort_table_key**: any dataframe will be sorted by this key. This should be a
  key that exists in all your databases. E.g. the metadata set by bamboost.
  `time_stamp`, `id`, ...
- **sort_table_order**: `asc` (ascending) or `desc` (descending) 


## Index

- **paths**: A list of paths in which to seearch for databases. The list will be
  searched from top to bottom. The last resort is always the users home
  directory.
