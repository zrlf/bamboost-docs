## Creating a `collection`

Collections are implicitally created if they don't exist yet. To create your first collection in a directory named `data-foo`, use
```python
from bamboost import Collection

coll = Collection("data-foo")
```
This will create the directory and assign the collection a unique ID (`uid`).

Once created, it is often easier and safer to use the uid to reference the collection.
```python
coll = Collection(uid="xxxx")
```

If you are working in an ipython session (e.g. a jupyter notebook), use `Collection.fromUID["xxxx"]` which will give you autocompletion for all of your existing (cached) collections.


### The CLI

`bamboost` comes with a CLI. If you run
```bash
bamboost-cli list
```
you should now see an entry.

<Callout>
You can also create collections with the CLI.
```bash
bamboost-cli new data-foo
```
Or scan for collections that are not cached
```bash
bamboost-cli index scan
```
</Callout>

## Creating a `simulation`
Now that you have a collection ready, you can easily create a simulation inside it.
```python
sim = coll.create_simulation(parameters={
    "param1": 73,
    "bar": [2, 3, 4, 5],
})
```
This will create a new simulation with a random name. Use the `name` argument to assign some specific name.

## Quick Example

```python
from bamboost.core import Collection
import numpy as np

# Create a new simulation collection
collection = Collection("./simulations")

# Create a simulation within the collection
simulation = collection.create_simulation(
    "test_run",
    parameters={"temperature": 300, "seed": 42},
)

# Store some data
simulation.root["temperature"] = np.array([300, 310, 320])
```
